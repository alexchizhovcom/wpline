##What is it for?
This single file script can be helpful in different ways:

1) You own WordPress website and you forgot your password and email and login. Strange, but could be :) <br>
You can upload this script via FTP and change your password or create a new user.

2) You are a developer and you have a lot of orders and clients give you ftp or database access, but no access for wordpress admin, you can just upload the script to the root directory, and create a user for yourself.

3) You can think of your own way of using it :)

## How to use
1) Take the file lineadmin.php and upload it via FTP to your WordPress root directory<br>
2) Go to your browser and navigate to YOURSITE.COM/lineadmin.php

You will see light administration panel, that will allow you to: <br>
1) See all the registered users<br>
2) Change users roles<br>
3) Change passwords<br>
4) Create new users<br>
5) Delete existing users

**IMPORTANT! Do not forget to delete this file from your server when you are done, because it is a HUGE backdoor to hack your website.**

Please enjoy,
and let me know if I can help you with this script or with your WordPress project
